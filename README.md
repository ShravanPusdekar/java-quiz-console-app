## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Overview

- **UI Components:**  
  Uses `Label`, `TextField`, `Button`, `HBox`, and `VBox` for structured layout.  
  Applies inline CSS to style background color and error messages.

- **Event Handling:**  
  Each operation button triggers the shared `calculate()` method with the operator as parameter.

- **Calculation Logic:**  
  Parses input text fields to integers, handles invalid inputs with exceptions, and manages division-by-zero error elegantly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- Support decimal (floating-point) calculations
- Add more operations (modulus, exponentiation)
- Enhance UI with CSS stylesheet for better theming
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for quick input and operations
- Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Make the app resizable and responsive
